# Palette Frontend
Ensure that you have installed all of the packages for this repo by running `yarn`.

To run the Palette app:
  1. Type in `expo start`. 
  2. Click "i" to open iOS Simulator or go to the expo tab in your browser and click `Run on iOS Simulator`

**Note:** If the app is being used for the first time in a while, the home screen may return a timeout error. This is because Heroku shuts down the backend server if it hasn't gotten any traffic recently, and there's not a ton we can do about this. If you encounter this error, please refresh the app in the simulator (press CMD+R twice).
